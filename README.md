- 👋 Hi, I’m @webminz a.k.a Patrick Stünkel, I’m a postdoctoral researcher working at [Haukeland University Hopsital](https://helse-bergen.no/).
- 👀 I’m interested in making Software Engineering as effortless and safe as possible.
- 💞️ I’m always looking for collaborators to improve [CorrLang](https://github.com/webminz/corr-lang), a semantic integration tool that I started during my [PhD](https://hvlopen.brage.unit.no/hvlopen-xmlui/handle/11250/2837740).
- 📫 You can also check out my personal [homepage](http://past.corrlang.io)!
